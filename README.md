# auto_nmapper

place both nmapper.sh and ultimate-nmap-parser.sh into the /usr/local/bin directory

Then navigate to the directory where you have your "hosts" file, of all the IP addresses to scan. **File should be called hosts**
File should also be in one host per line format or one CIDR notation per line

once in that directory just run python host_scanning.py

When done results will be in the nmap/full/parse directory
